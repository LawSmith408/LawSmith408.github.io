Development of the design intuition required to create novel mechanical systems costs time: time to create candidate systems, build them, test them, and critique them.
As the mechanics governing design spaces become increasingly nonlinear and surprising, our ability to reason from prior knowledge weakens, and these costs increase.
It is in these complex, rugged design spaces that the development of design intuition is most challenging, and simultaneously, where the application of automated, computational design is potentially most helpful.

My specialty lies in nudging design efforts foward across uncertain terrain using numerical modeling, deep knowledge of traditional and emerging fabrication technologies, and first principles thinking. 

I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Intitute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/en) developing soft electrostatic transducers. I hold a PhD and MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder, and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. 

Between degrees, I spent a few years working as an engineering consultant specializing in medical device design at [Triple Ring Technologies](https://www.tripleringtech.com/) in Newark, CA. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and running around Stuttgart, cluttering my apartment with trinkets, and playing billiards.
