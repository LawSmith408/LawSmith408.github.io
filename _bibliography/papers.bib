    abstract = {Most applications of 3-dimensional (3D) printing for presurgical planning have been limited to bony structures and simple morphological descriptions of complex organs due to the fundamental limitations in accuracy, quality, and efficiency of the current modeling paradigm. This has largely ignored the soft tissue critical to most surgical specialties where the interior of an object matters and anatomical boundaries transition gradually. Therefore, the needs of the biomedical industry to replicate human tissue, which displays multiple scales of organization and varying material distributions, necessitate new forms of representation. Presented here is a novel technique to create 3D models directly from medical images, which are superior in spatial and contrast resolution to current 3D modeling methods and contain previously unachievable spatial fidelity and soft tissue differentiation. Also presented are empirical measurements of novel, additively manufactured composites that span the gamut of material stiffnesses seen in soft biological tissues from MRI and CT. These unique volumetric design and printing methods allow for deterministic and continuous adjustment of material stiffness and color. This capability enables an entirely new application of additive manufacturing to presurgical planning: mechanical realism. As a natural complement to existing models that provide appearance matching, these new models also allow medical professionals to "feel" the spatially varying material properties of a tissue simulant-a critical addition to a field in which tactile sensation plays a key role.}

The thermomechanical deformation of 3DP elements is determined by the geometry and extent of the isotropic and anisotropic regions. The synthesis and experimental characterization of the 3DP elements are complemented by finite element analysis (FEA). Calculations emphasize that the cuboidal deformation of the myriad 3DP elements is a manifestation of local stress gradients imparted by local control of the material composition and anisotropy. Varying the rectilinear spatial distribution of the multimaterial elastomer composites produces complex, multistable states that provide insights into how stress gradients drive multimaterial elastomer actuation. The thermomechanical stimuli response of the multimaterial elements is explored as a tactile element.}

    abstract = {Nitinol is a smart material that can be used as an actuator, a sensor, or a structural element, and has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities of microrobots. Femtosecond laser technology can be used to process nitinol while avoiding heat-affected zones (HAZ), thus retaining superelastic properties. In this work, we manufacture living hinges of arbitrary cross sections from nitinol using a femtosecond laser micromachining process. We first determined the laser cutting parameters, 4.1Jcm−2 fluence with 5 passes for 5μm ablation, by varying laser power level and number of passes. Next, we modeled the hinges using an analytical model as well as creating an Abaqus finite element method, and showed the accuracy of the models by comparing them to the torque produced by eight different hinges, four with a rectangular cross section and four with an elliptic notch cross section. Finally, we manufactured a prototype miniature device to illustrate the usefulness of these nitinol hinges: a piezoelectric actuated robotic wing mechanism, and we characterized its performance.}

    abstract = {Soft robotics offers a range of attractive features relative to traditional rigid robots, including inherently safer human-robot interactions, and continuous passive dynamics that enable morphological computation. Here we present an actuator with an integrated print-in-place strain sensor which is produced entirely via multi-material additive manufacturing and requires no post processing or manual fabrication steps. One natural application of this technology is the end effector of robotic arms; incorporating deformable actuators into a gripping mechanism allows for the safe integration of robotic assistance in human-occupied settings. While numerous soft robot actuators have been implemented without feedback, force sensing and proprioception are valuable signals to leverage in extending the capabilities of these systems. Prior approaches to integrating sensors into soft robot components have relied on manual processes, or specialized fabrication tools. Our work shows a novel method for automatically manufacturing soft pneumatically-driven actuators with embedded sensors through readily available 3D printing tools with no human fabrication required. Automatically manufacturing these sensor-actuator systems enables more complex, capable, and integrate-able designs, because the labor of assembly is eliminated; actuator-sensor designs that would be tedious or impossible to manufacture become tractable with our approach.}

Soft robots are challenging to design and fabricate, and most actuators are designed by trial and error and fabricated using labor-intensive multi-step casting processes. We present an integrated collection of software tools that address several limitations in the existing design and fabrication workflow for pneumatic soft actuators. We use implicit geometry functions to specify geometry and material distribution, a GUI-based software tool for interactive exploration of computational network representations of these implicit functions, and an automated tool for generating rapid simulation results of candidate designs. We prioritize seamless connectivity between all stages of the design and fabrication process, and elimination of steps that require human intervention. The software tools presented here integrate with existing capabilities for multimaterial additive manufacturing, and are also forward-compatible with emerging automated design techniques. The workflow presented here is intended as a community resource, and aimed at lowering barriers for the discovery of novel soft actuators by experts and novice users. The data gathered from human-interaction with this tool will be used by future automation tools to enable fully-automated soft actuator design based on high-level specifications.}

    abstract = {Soft robotics embraces the design philosophy of function through morphology. Therefore defining the affordances of a soft robotic structure is equivalent to determining the composition and distribution of the materials that make up the robot. This design process has historically been dominated by human intuition and labor-intensive experimentation. However, the design space of multi-material continuum structures is infinite. Automation tools to accelerate soft robot design could enable new designs to be created on-demand, specific to a need, more rapidly and at lower cost than would be possible using human labor alone. In this work we formulate the soft robot design problem as a multi-objective optimization task. We demonstrate a design automation system for bending soft actuators which integrates multi-objective heuristic search with a powerful generative encoding that converts high level design goals, compliance and forcefulness in our case, into mechanical designs automatically. These designs can be directly fabricated using a 3-D printer. We compare numerous simulated results from our optimization and a physical instance fabricated via 3-D printing with a broad survey of contemporary results from the soft robotics literature.}

In this work, continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties is demonstrated in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents are experimentally characterized, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, inverse material design is enabled; the method is showcased by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. The properties of these composites are placed in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue mimics.}

These pumps consist of high power micro-resistors, which we term thermal micro-pump (TMP) resistors, that locally boil fluid at the resistor surface in microseconds creating a vapor bubble to perform mechanical work. Conventional fabrication approaches of thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps and associated microfluidics have utilized semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques requiring expensive tooling with long turn around times on the order of weeks to months. In this study, we present a low-cost approach to rapidly fabricate and test thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps with associated microfluidics utilizing commercial substrates (indium tin oxide, ITO, and fluorine doped tin oxide, FTO, coated glass) and tooling (laser cutter). The presented fabrication approach greatly reduces the turn around time from weeks/months for conventional micro-fabrication to a matter of hours/days allowing acceleration of thermal bubble-driven micro-pump research and development (R&D) learning cycles.}

While permitting the explicit translation of multimodal medical data into physical objects, this approach also bypasses the need to process data into mesh-based boundary representations, alleviating the potential loss and remodeling of information. After evaluating the optical characteristics of test specimens generated with our correlative data-driven method, we culminate with multimodal real-world 3D-printed examples, thus highlighting current and potential applications for improved surgical planning, communication, and clinical decision-making through this approach.}

    abstract = {Traditional methods of shielding fragile goods and human tissues from impact energy rely on isotropic foam materials. The mechanical properties of these foams are inferior to an emerging class of metamaterials called plate lattices, which have predominantly been fabricated in simple 2.5-dimensional geometries using conventional methods that constrain the feasible design space. In this work, additive manufacturing is used to relax these constraints and realize plate lattice metamaterials with nontrivial, locally varying geometry. The limitations of traditional computer-aided design tools are circumvented and allow the simulation of complex buckling and collapse behaviors without a manual meshing step. By validating these simulations against experimental data from tests on fabricated samples, sweeping exploration of the plate lattice design space is enabled. Numerical and experimental tests demonstrate plate lattices absorb up to six times more impact energy at equivalent densities relative to foams and shield objects from impacts ten times more energetic while transmitting equivalent peak stresses. In contrast to previous investigations of plate lattice metamaterials, designs with nonuniform geometric prebuckling in the out-of-plane direction is explored and showed that these designs exhibit 10% higher energy absorption efficiency on average and 25% higher in the highest-performing design.}
