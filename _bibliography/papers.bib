    abstract = {Mechanical properties of traditional engineering materials are typically coupled to each other, presenting a challenge to practitioners with multi-dimensional material property requirements. In this work, continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties is demonstrated in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents are experimentally characterized, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, inverse material design is enabled; the method is showcased by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. The properties of these composites are placed in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue mimics.}
